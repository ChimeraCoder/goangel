GoAngel
=========

GoAngel is a simple Go client library for interfacing with the AngelList API. The results of API queries are deserialized into static structs for convenience, so that a successful API call should yield a predictable, known type with no need for type assertions.


The current release implements most endpoints, though it is not yet complete.

c.Client_id = "your-angel-client-id"
c.Client_secret = "your-angel-client-secret"

//To perform authenticated queries (which includes any PUT/POST/DELETE queries)
//you need an access token

url := c.AuthorizeUri()

//Redirect users to url, and record the code sent in the callback

//You can now perform authenticated queries against the AngelList API
